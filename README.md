Technical Details
To develop the FinEdge website, I have utilized React.js and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a robust and modern development stack. React.js provides a component-based architecture, facilitating modular development and code reusability. Tailwind CSS, a highly customizable CSS framework, enables us to create a responsive and visually appealing design.

The website is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. The use of Tailwind CSS aids in building a responsive layout by leveraging its utility classes for responsive design
